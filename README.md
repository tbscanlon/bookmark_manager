CRUD
----
CRUD stands for 'Create, Read, Update, Delete' which are the 4 basic functions of persistence storage

SQL
---
SQL means 'Structured Query Language' which is a standardised language used for databases based on the relational model.

SQL Examples for each CRUD action
---------------------------------
**Create(Insert)**  
This command creates new rows in a table:

```SQL
INSERT INTO "<table name>" VALUES ('NAME');
```
When making the columns(fields), the ID value is generated by SQL.  
Use double quotes("") for table names and single quotes('') when passing strings to populate the rows.


**Read(Select)**  
```SQL
SELECT * FROM <table name>;
```
This selects everything (\*) from the table (id and name in the example below)

E.g.

|id | name|
|----|-----|
|1|Miho|
(1 row)

**Update(Update)**  
To change the existing values in the database, we can use the UPDATE command to specify the id of the entry.
```SQL
UPDATE "<table name>" SET <column name> = 'name' WHERE ID = <id num>;
```
This will return a confirmation of the UPDATE
```
UPDATE 1
```
Then you can run another SELECT query to see if the changes have taken place.

**Delete(Destroy)**  
To remove a row from a table, use the DELETE command.

```SQL
DELETE FROM "<table name>" WHERE ID = <id num>;
```
Again, you will receive a confirmation of the deletion.
```
DELETE 1
```
